CopyPLUS
===

PopClip extension to append the selection to the current contents in the clipboard. *This is a duplicate of an existing extension (Append) with just slightly better UTF-8 handling, and modifier key handling for copying with and without linebreaks and whitespace.*

* Hold Command (⌘) when clicking to add an extra line break between entries.
* Hold Option (⌥) to append with no extra whitespace.
